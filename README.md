After working in the fashion industry for almost 10 years, I wanted (needed) to move in a new direction that was both challenging and rewarding. What initially led me to fashion was the creative platform in a high pressure environment, where ideas flourish and problems are solved, where the ‘impossible’ is made possible. 
 
Therefore, I think I have found my home in being a developer, as this seems to be the epicentre of that environment, utilizing my skills and keen work ethic that I obtained in my previous life, and applied it to the exciting world of programming, where everything can change because of a line of code.

#### Thrives under pressure
 
When the dust from the pandemic settled and work started to go back to normal I was brought back from being on furlough alongside my manager. We went from a seven person team to just two. Despite the heavy workload and pressure we successfully maintained all accounts, while my manager handled the mess that had COVID left behind I picked up all new business, producing up to 350,000 garments a week - just 30% less than pre-pandemic.
I not only handled my larger more stressful workload I excelled at it, my can-do and positive attitude to get the job done teamed with my strong organisation and time management skills play a key part.
 
#### Excellent Communicator
 
My excellent communication and team-working skills strengthened whilst working in my previous roles, working across multiple accounts and collections required liaising with many internal and external teams. Keeping everyone updated was a daily task for me, essential to keep the business moving without fault. At least once a week I would send a full update to all needed.
