## Background & Motivation

After working in the fashion industry for almost 10 years, I wanted (needed) to move in a new direction that was both more challenging and rewarding. While furloughed from my most recent position I was able to reflect on my situation and explore new career possibilities. I have always been interested in tech and with many friends already in the industry, I naturally found myself gravitating towards it. It became increasingly clear that almost every element of the modern world relied on tech in some way and I wanted to be involved. I began teaching myself Ruby and quickly realised how much I loved to code.

What initially led me to fashion was the creative platform in a high-pressure environment, where ideas flourish and problems are solved and programming is the epicentre of that environment. I can utilise my skills and keen work ethic obtained in my previous life, and apply it to the exciting world of tech, where everything can change because of a line of code.

## Soft Skills
 
### Thrives under pressure
 
When the dust from the pandemic settled and business at Misfit Fashion started to pick up again, I returned after being on furlough, alongside my manager. We went from a seven-person team to just two. Despite the heavy workload and pressure we successfully maintained all accounts. I took control of all new business, producing up to 350,000 garments a week - just 30% less than pre-pandemic. My positive, can-do attitude paired with my strong organisational and time management allowed me to excel at handling this large, stressful workload alone.
 
### Communication and Teamwork
 
My excellent communication and team-working skills strengthened whilst working in my previous roles. Working across multiple accounts and collections required liaising with many internal and external teams. Keeping everyone updated was a daily task for me and essential to keep the business moving without fault. At least once a week I would send a full update to all needed.
