## Background & Motivation

I am a passionate, highly driven software developer and a recent graduate of Makers Academy. With a wealth of experience in high-pressure environments, the fashion industry gave me a creative platform where my ideas could flourish and be developed into products and programming is the epicentre of that domain. Keen to utilise my skills in a more challenging way I decided to pursue coding and a path of life long learning. Now applying my keen work ethic obtained in my previous life to the exciting world of tech, where everything can change because of a line of code.

## Soft Skills
 
### Thrives under pressure
 
When the dust from the pandemic settled and business at Misfit Fashions started to pick up again, I returned after being on furlough, alongside my manager. We went from a seven-person team to just two. Despite the heavy workload and pressure we successfully maintained all accounts. I took control of all new business, producing up to 350,000 garments a week - just 30% less than pre-pandemic. My positive, can-do attitude paired with my strong organisational and time management allowed me to excel at handling this large, stressful workload alone.

### Problem Solver

During my time in fashion I developed a keen eye for recognising problems early and finding solutions fast. The enjoyment I got from fixing a problem was at the core of my decision in becoming a developer. I get engrossed in barriers and bugs that inevitably arise within a project and love working to unblock them. I have found my commitment to this skill in particular has been a considerable advantage for me whilst studying software development. 

### Drive

I‚Äôm highly motivated and not afraid of a challenge. I completed the 12-week Makers Academy coding bootcamp as a remote student which required an incredible amount of discipline, focus and a large dose of self-belief.

 
### Communication
 
 I am an excellent communicator and team player. For many years I have worked in ever-changing teams across multiple accounts and collections. When a team changes regularly, being a good communicator is key to keep things moving without fault. Having the ability to communicate the business‚Äôs unique challenges to new members has made me an excellent team player.
